WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:11.408
We're going to use matplotlib
within the Jupyter Notebook,

2
00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:13.710
just like with did with pandas.

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.218
Jupyter has some specialized support for
matplotlib and

4
00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:21.390
this is enabled by using the IPython
magic %matplotlib notebook.

5
00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:27.064
Remember that in the Jupyter Notebook, the
IPython magics are just helper functions

6
00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:31.050
which set up the environment so that
the web based rendering can be enabled.

7
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.510
matplotlib itself can work well
outside of the Jupyter environment.

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.790
But for this course, we're going to focus
on its use within the web environment in

9
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.170
part because of how popular Jupyter
has become in data science practice.

10
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.420
So what actually has happened when you
run the magic function matplotlib with

11
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.940
the inline parameter, is that matplotlib
is configured to render into the browser.

12
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.433
This configuration is called a backend,
and

13
00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:59.721
matplotlib has a number of
different backends available.

14
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:02.859
A backend is an abstraction layer
which knows how to interact with

15
00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.170
the operating environment,
whether it's an operating system, or

16
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.990
an environment like the browser, and
knows how to render matplotlib commands.

17
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.130
In fact, there's a number of
different interactive backends, but

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.070
there are also backends called hard copy
backends, which support rendering to

19
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.321
graphics formats, like scalable
vector graphics, SVGs, or PNGs.

20
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.590
So not all backends support all features,
especially interactive features,

21
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.340
which we'll touch on later in this course.

22
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.730
Let's import the matplotlib library,
which we'll do as mpl, and

23
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.520
call get backend to make sure
we're using the NbAgg backend.

24
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.730
Great, you'll notice that matplotlib has
a lot of non-Pythonic naming conventions.

25
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.150
In particular, you'll be accessing
variables using the Get and Set.

26
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.030
Which is an accessor pattern which is
more common in languages like Java.

27
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.630
This is just something you have to get
used to, but remember you can hit Tab for

28
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.510
type hint autocompletion
in the Jupyter Notebook.

29
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.930
So this can help you find
the functions that you're looking for.

30
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.930
Now we're not going to spend much
time with the backend layer, but

31
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.670
it's important to be aware of.

32
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.583
If you're on Mac OS, for instance,

33
00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:14.020
your default backend when using
matplotlib is one system.

34
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.710
While on Linux, GTK is my default backend.

35
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.880
The next layer is where we'll
spend most of our time though, and

36
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.740
that's called the artist layer.

37
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.920
The artist layer is an abstraction
around drawing and layout primitives.

38
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.090
The root of visuals is a set of containers
which includes a figure object with one or

39
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.950
more subplots,
each with a series of one or more axes.

40
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.859
This last object, the axes is the most
common one you'll interact with,

41
00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.584
changing the range of a given axis or
plotting shapes to it.

42
00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:48.190
And just a brief aside, especially since
this is a global classroom with people

43
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.865
from around the world enrolled where
English might not be their first language,

44
00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:58.242
matplotlib relies heavily on the axes
object, which is the plural form of axis.

45
00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:01.450
But matplotlib also has
an axis object as well.

46
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.740
And an axes is actually made
up of two axis objects.

47
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.900
One for the x, horizontal dimension.

48
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.970
And one for the y, or vertical dimension.

49
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.350
So you might hear me pronouncing
these two words, axes and

50
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.300
axis a bit more intentionally
than I would in regular speech

51
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.240
in order to help make
things easier to follow.

52
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.510
The artist layer also contains
primitives and collections.

53
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.770
These are base drawing items, things
like a rectangle, ellipse or a line.

54
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.910
And collections of items,

55
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.410
such as a path, which might capture many
lines together into a polygon shape.

56
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.700
Collections are easy to recognize as their
name tends to end in the word collection.

57
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.183
It's worth taking a moment to look at
the kinds of artists which are available.

58
00:03:45.674 --> 00:03:49.020
Here's an image from the matplotlib
documentation on artists.

59
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.140
You'll see that there's lots of
child objects of the artists object,

60
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.155
and that one of them is
called patches.patch.

61
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.199
This name comes from the matlab
roots of the project.

62
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:05.996
And a patch is any two-dimensional object
which has a face color and an edge color.

63
00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:10.095
And children of the patch class
are the primitives, as we've discussed.

64
00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:14.265
Okay, so matplotlib has two layers.

65
00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:18.315
A backend layer, which knows about low
level graphics routines it can render to

66
00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:20.165
the screen or to a file.

67
00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:22.555
We'll use the inline backend for
most of our work.

68
00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:28.635
And the artist layer, which describes
primitives, collections, and containers.

69
00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.245
It knows how figures
are composed of subfigures and

70
00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:35.120
where objects are in a given
axes coordinate system.

71
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.158
So with this, we can actually get started
building figures and rendering them.

72
00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:42.254
But there's one more layer which
is extremely important for

73
00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:46.270
us as data scientists in particular,
and this is called the scripting layer.

74
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.090
You see, if we were writing
an application to use matplotlib,

75
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.410
we might never care about
the scripting layer.

76
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.150
But this layer helps simplify and speed
up our interaction with the environment

77
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.600
in order to build plots quickly.

78
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.320
It does this, frankly,
by doing a bunch of magic for us.

79
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.420
And the difference between someone
who is effective with matplotlib and

80
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.810
someone who isn't,

81
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.550
is usually based on their understanding
of this magic of the scripting layer.

82
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.630
The scripting layer we use in
this course is called pyplot.

83
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.170
So that describes
the matplotlib layer cake.

84
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.097
There's a backend,
which deals with actual drawing.

85
00:05:22.097 --> 00:05:26.830
A bunch of artists on top of the backend,
which describe how data is arranged.

86
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.200
And a scripting layer,
which actually creates those artists and

87
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.709
choreographs them all together.

88
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.220
I just want to address one
more topic before we move on,

89
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.760
and that's the difference
between procedural and

90
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.935
declarative visualization libraries and,
well, user interfaces more generally.

91
00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:48.476
The pyplot scripting layer is a procedural
method for building a visualization,

92
00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:52.480
in that we tell the underlying software
which drawing actions we want it to take

93
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.580
in order to render our data.

94
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.803
There are also declarative methods for
visualizing data.

95
00:05:57.803 --> 00:06:00.300
HTML is a great example of this.

96
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.900
Instead of issuing command after
command to the backend rendering agent,

97
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.060
which is the browser with HTML,
HTML documents are formatted as models

98
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.430
of relationships in a document, often
called the DOM, or Document Object Model.

99
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.130
These are two fundamentally
different ways of creating and

100
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.860
representing graphical interfaces.

101
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.919
The popular JavaScript library,
for instance,

102
00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.422
D3.JS is an example of a declarative
information visualization method.

103
00:06:27.422 --> 00:06:30.400
While matplotlib's pyplot is
an example of a procedural

104
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.390
information visualization method.

105
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.020
In the next lecture, we're going to get
dirty and start making some graphs.

106
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.420
But before we do that, I wanted you to
check out an article by John Hunter and

107
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.175
Michael Droettboom.

108
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.380
While now a bit dated, this article was
published in the second volume of the book

109
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.680
Architecture of Open Source Applications,
and provides a little more context for

110
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.889
the architecture of matplotlib.
