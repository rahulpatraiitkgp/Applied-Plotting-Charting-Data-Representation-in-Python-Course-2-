00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:13.828
So far we focused on static images, but
matplotlib does have some support for

2
00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:16.900
both animation and interactivity.

3
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.700
We call this the backend that
renders the plot to the stream.

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.240
Animation and interactivity heavily depend
on support from this backend layer.

5
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.070
And using a backend like the image
png1 doesn't provide this.

6
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.720
However, the NBN backend or the matplotlib
notebook magic function does provide for

7
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.259
some interactivity, so
we can leverage that here.

8
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.890
The Maplotlib.animation module contains
important helpers for building animations.

9
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.170
For our discussion, the important
object here is to call FuncAnimation.

10
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.267
And it builds an animation by iteratively
calling a function which you define.

11
00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:58.822
Essentially, your function will
either clear the axis object and

12
00:00:58.822 --> 00:01:01.613
redraw the next frame,
which you want users to see or

13
00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:04.550
will return a list of objects
which need to be redrawn.

14
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.050
Let's see an example.

15
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.730
First, let's import the animation module.

16
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.029
Next, let's define a cut-off for
our animation.

17
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.220
I'd like to show you how the histogram is
built from one sample through 100 samples.

18
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.840
So let's set our cut off to 100
then randomly pick 100 numbers and

19
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.920
put them into a variable.

20
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.940
Okay, next we want to actually create
a function which will do the plotting.

21
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.709
We'll call this function update.

22
00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.586
Now the matplotlib FuncAnimation object is
going to call this every few milliseconds

23
00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:43.187
and pass in the frame number we
are on starting with frame zero.

24
00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:47.370
So we can use this is as the index into
our array values, which we called x.

25
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.310
The very first thing we want to
do is see if the current frame

26
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.040
is at the end of our list.

27
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.630
If so,
we need to tell the animation to stop.

28
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.130
We do this by calling the stop object
on the event source object attached

29
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.657
to the FuncAnimation object.

30
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.650
We're going to call our animation a.

31
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.610
So, I'll just use that here.

32
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.430
I didn't know we can just
drop plot as per normal.

33
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.840
So lets first clear
the current axis with cla,

34
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.290
then create a histogram using a set of
value in the x up to the current value.

35
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.980
Slicing is great for this.

36
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.880
Now we also need to consider the bins.

37
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.209
Previously we just passed a single
number in for the bins eg 10 or 100.

38
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.420
But we can also pass in
the spacing in between bins.

39
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.770
Since we want all of our bins set and
evenly spaced, because we're redrawing

40
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.770
the animation in each clock tick,
we can use the NumPy arange function.

41
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.590
This will ensure that
the bins don't change.

42
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.649
We use the balance of minus 4 to plus 4,
in half-step increments.

43
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.930
We also need to set the axis
values since otherwise,

44
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.600
the histogram will continually autoscale
between frames which could be annoying.

45
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.250
So I'll just hard code some values here,
often the bin sizes and use 30 as an x and

46
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.820
a couple of labels and titles to
make the chart look a little better.

47
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.690
Finally, let me show you another
text function called annotate.

48
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.610
This places text at a certain
position in the chart and

49
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.930
we'll use it to show how many samples are
currently being rendered to the screen.

50
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.850
Now let's just generate a new figure, then
call the FuncAnimation constructor and

51
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.270
we'll assign this to variable a.

52
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.510
The first parameter is the figure
that we're working with.

53
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.720
This isn't so important here,

54
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.720
since we're using the pipe plot scripting
interface to manage the figure.

55
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.750
Then the name of our function and then the
amount of time we want between updates.

56
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.220
Let's set this to 100 milliseconds.

57
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.150
Also, remember that we have
to set this to variable a.

58
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.979
Otherwise, our function isn't going
to know how to stop the animation.

59
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.820
There we go.

60
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.143
A nice example of how sampling from a
distribution an be used with an animation.

61
00:04:01.503 --> 00:04:05.730
FuncAnimation like most of the other
classes in the animation package is

62
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.780
a subclass of the animation object.

63
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.570
The animation object has
a handy safe function,

64
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.590
which allows you to write
the animation to a file.

65
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.510
This requires additional
third party library such as

66
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.790
FFM page which can take
a bit to install and set up.

67
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.334
But the result is that you can fairly
easily export your animations directly

68
00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:28.246
from the Jupiter Web
programming environment.

69
00:04:28.246 --> 00:04:33.164
A figure animation with four sub-plots,
one for each kind of distribution we might

70
00:04:33.164 --> 00:04:37.400
be interested in understanding,
could be pretty neat.

71
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.270
We could plot the samples for the normal
distribution in one, for a gamma

72
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.540
distribution in another, and then maybe
a couple of paramaterized distributions

73
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.920
like the normal distribution with
different levels of standard deviation.

74
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.060
This would be a great way to practice the
skills that you've learned in this module,

75
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.910
as it would require that you manage
multiple sub-plots within an animation

76
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.880
using histograms.

77
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.970
In the next lecture, we'll dig into
this event framework a bit more and

78
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.040
look at the interactivity.
