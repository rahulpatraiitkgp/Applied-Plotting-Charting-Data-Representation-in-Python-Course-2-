00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:13.140
A histogram is a bar chart which shows
the frequency of a given phenomena.

2
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.080
A great example
are probability distributions.

3
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.690
For instance, in the first
course in this specialization,

4
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.720
we touched on the difference between
the random, uniform, normal, and

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.050
chi squared distributions.

6
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.260
Probability function can be visualized
as a curve, where the y-axis holds

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.100
the probability a given value would occur,
and the x-axis is the value itself.

8
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.440
This is called a probability
density function.

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.610
The y-axis values are limited to between
zero and one, where zero means there's no

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.910
chance of a given value occurring and one
means that the value will always occur.

11
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.260
The x-axis values are labeled in
terms of the distribution function.

12
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.870
In the case of the normal distribution,

13
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.350
this is usually in terms
of standard deviations.

14
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.700
So a histogram is just a bar chart where
the x-axis is a given observation and

15
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.330
the y-axis is the frequency with
which that observation occurs.

16
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.640
So we should be able to plot
a given probability distribution

17
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.639
by sampling from it.

18
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.100
Now, recall that sampling means
that we just pick a number out of

19
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.140
the distribution, like rolling a die or
pulling a single card out of a deck.

20
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.830
As we do this over and over again,

21
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.900
we get a more accurate
description of the distribution.

22
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.190
Let's pull some samples from
the normal distribution and

23
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.170
plot four different
histograms as subplots.

24
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.470
First I'll create our 2 x
2 grade of axis objects.

25
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.870
In this case, we don't want to
share the y-axis between the plots

26
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.300
since we're intentionally looking at
a number of different sizes of samples.

27
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.290
We're mostly interested in how
uniform the distribution looks.

28
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.954
Then we can iterate through a list
of four different values, 10, 100,

29
00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:57.905
1,000 and 10,000.

30
00:01:57.905 --> 00:01:59.670
And we'll pull samples from the NumPy.

31
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.990
Remember that the normal function of
random just creates a list of numbers

32
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.230
based on the underlying
normal distribution.

33
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.250
We can then plot these to a given
axis object using the hist function.

34
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.659
And set the title as appropriate.

35
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.458
Well, there we go.

36
00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:20.555
The first plot only has ten samples,
so it looks pretty jagged.

37
00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:23.953
And in my version here I don't think
anyone would say this is obviously

38
00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:25.170
a normal distribution.

39
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.830
When we jump to 100 samples,
it gets better, but still quite jagged.

40
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.140
Then it seems to smooth out a bit on
the plots for 1,000 and 10,000 samples.

41
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.650
But if we look closely, we can see
that the bar of the 10,000 plots

42
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.300
are actually wider than those of the 10 or
the 100 plot.

43
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.160
What's going on here?

44
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.324
By default, the histogram in Matplotlib
uses ten bins, that is ten different bars.

45
00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:57.020
Here we created a shared x-axis, and
as we sample more from the distribution,

46
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.600
we're more likely to get outlier
values further from our mean.

47
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.720
Thus, ten bins for n=10 is at
best capturing ten unique values,

48
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.970
while for n=10,000, many values have
to be combined into a single bin.

49
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.152
Let's do the same function
with the bin set to 100

50
00:03:58.547 --> 00:04:02.264
Now we see that the 10,000 sampled
plot looks much smoother than all of

51
00:04:02.264 --> 00:04:03.730
the others.

52
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.732
And the 10 sample plot shows that each
sample is basically in its own bin.

53
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.510
So I think this brings up an important
question of how many bins you should

54
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.998
plot when using a histogram.

55
00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:17.550
I'm afraid that the answer
isn't really clear.

56
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.688
Both of these plots are true,
one is a visual of the data

57
00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:25.250
at a coarse granularity, and
one at a more fine grain granularity.

58
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.060
When we look at the finest granularity
in our data, plotting with 10,000 bins

59
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.710
then the histograms became basically
useless for decision making.

60
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.469
Since they aren't showing trends between
samples as much as they're just showing

61
00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:39.780
the sample size themselves.

62
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.540
This is similar to using
aggregate statistics

63
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.460
like the mean in standard deviation
to describe a sample of a population.

64
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.965
These values are coarse and

65
00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:53.360
whether they are appropriate depends
highly on your questions and interests.

66
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.220
I've linked here to an optional
reading which considers the issue

67
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.010
of how many bins are appropriate from
a couple of different statistical stances.

68
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.006
But keep in mind this understanding
that there's just no right or wrong,

69
00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.842
just useful and useless for a given need.

70
00:05:10.842 --> 00:05:13.797
I want to use our newfound
knowledge of histograms and

71
00:05:13.797 --> 00:05:18.962
subplots to introduce you to a more
flexible GridSpec layout for subplots.

72
00:05:18.962 --> 00:05:22.900
The GridSpec allows you to map axes
over multiple cells in a grid.

73
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.061
For instance, let's create a scatter
plot where the y values come from

74
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:32.476
the normal distribution, and the x
values come from a random distribution.

75
00:05:32.476 --> 00:05:37.178
It's not totally clear from looking at
this plot what the actual distributions

76
00:05:37.178 --> 00:05:40.403
are for each axis, but
we could add two smaller plots,

77
00:05:40.403 --> 00:05:43.297
each histograms,
to make this a bit more clear.

78
00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:54.040
I'm going to define a 3x3 grid,
nine cells in total.

79
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.290
I want the first histogram to take up the
top right space, and the second histogram

80
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.970
to take up the far left bottom two spaces,
rotated on its side.

81
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.610
The original scatter plot can take up
a two by two square in the bottom right.

82
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.380
To use the GridSpec,

83
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.500
we first import it, then create a new
GridSpec, the overall shape that we want.

84
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.010
When we add new items with the subplot,

85
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.510
instead of specifying the three
numbers of row, column and

86
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.900
position, we pass in the elements of the
GridSpec object which we wish to cover.

87
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.640
And very important here.

88
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.427
Because we are using the elements of a
list, all of the indexing starts at zero,

89
00:06:32.427 --> 00:06:36.795
and is very reasonable to use slicing for
the beginning or ends of lists.

90
00:06:39.604 --> 00:06:43.769
The GridSpec is indexed as rows and
columns using the indexing operator, or

91
00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.480
square brackets.

92
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.960
So we'll create the first subplot and
histogram in row 0,

93
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.490
covering off the first element, the middle
position, and going to the end of the row.

94
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.392
We'll create the side_histogram
starting in row 1, and

95
00:06:57.392 --> 00:07:00.680
continuing to the end of row elements,
but limited to the 0 column.

96
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.790
Finally we'll create the scatter
plot in the lower_right.

97
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.130
When we execute this,
we see our basic set of plots, great.

98
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.100
Now, let's fill this with some data.

99
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.205
First the scatter plot, then the top
histogram, which is for the x values,

100
00:07:17.205 --> 00:07:19.468
then the side histogram for the y values.

101
00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:32.972
And we want the side
histogram to be lined up, so

102
00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:36.300
let's rotate the layout by
setting the orientation.

103
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.585
There are actually a few ways of
doing this, but since it's so common,

104
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:43.410
Matplotlib has an orientation parameter
which we can set to horizontal.

105
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.540
Okay, this is close.

106
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.700
We don't really care about the value
of the y-axes for the top histogram or

107
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.880
the value of the x-axes for
the bottom histogram.

108
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.530
Since these are probability
density histograms,

109
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.810
we care only about the relative values.

110
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.350
One handy function of an axes
object is that you can clear it.

111
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.890
So we don't have to
create a new figure and

112
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.820
do all the GridSpec work all over again.

113
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.820
So let's just call the clear
function on the two histograms.

114
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.610
Then we can call the hist function
with the normed=True argument.

115
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.070
Which tells Matplotlib to scale
the frequency data in the histogram

116
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.570
between 0 and 1.

117
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:25.090
Also we can flip the axes of
the left-hand side histogram

118
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.076
using the invert_xaxis function.

119
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.650
This gives us a rough solution.

120
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.092
We can see that the axes
values are not aligned.

121
00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:37.130
Unfortunately, Matplotlib requires that
you share axes when creating plots, and

122
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.820
we can't do that post hoc sharing.

123
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.440
We can however, set the range of the axis
to clear things up a little bit more.

124
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.870
And we do this using the axes set_xlim and
set_ylim values.

125
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.200
I'll just hard code some of
these in here to demonstrate.

126
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.600
And there we go.

127
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.300
We can see that our top histogram
is random, pretty uniform, and

128
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.279
that the histogram for the y values indeed
looks like the normal distribution.

129
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.780
In fact, this image looks sort of crudely
like the image we looked at in the first

130
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.540
module of this course, from the MIT and
Harvard study on MOOC engagement.

131
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.000
And it should be pretty clear to
you now how we might adjust various

132
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.450
aspects of this plot so

133
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.740
that if we wanted to look even more
like that engagement image, we could.

134
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.590
In the next lecture,

135
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.300
we're going to take a look at
another kind of plot, the box plot.
