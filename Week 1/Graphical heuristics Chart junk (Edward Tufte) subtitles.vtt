1
00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:13.470
Another heuristic which Edward Tufte
introduces us to is called chartjunk.

2
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.980
Now Tufte is much more damning of
chartjunk than he is of other forms

3
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.530
of non-data ink.

4
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.920
Indeed, he suggests that artistic
decorations on statistical graphs are like

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.970
weeds in our data graphics.

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.120
He suggested there's really
three kinds of chartjunk.

7
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.500
The first is unintended optical art.

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.770
For instance, excessive shading or
patterning of chart features,

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.650
such as shown in this economics graphic
which Tufte shares in his book,

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.790
The Visual Display of
Quantitative Information.

11
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.745
Here, the patterns make the human
eye jump and cause visual fatigue.

12
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.270
These phenomenon
are called moiré patterns.

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.435
And this is the same reason you don't
usually see people wearing stripe shirts

14
00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:53.769
when filming video content like this MOOC,

15
00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.383
since the low resolution of the video
accentuates the moiré issue.

16
00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.790
Tufte suggests that instead
of patterning this content,

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.410
one is better off labeling
the chart graphics directly.

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.338
We saw that being used in the data ink
ratio example by Darkhorse Analytics.

19
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.912
The second form of chartjunk is the grid.

20
00:01:13.912 --> 00:01:17.100
Tufte suggested the grid is both
unnecessary as data ink, but

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.000
also causes competition with
the actual data being shared.

22
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.140
Thinning, removing, or desaturating grid
lines makes it easier to see the data,

23
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.920
instead of being overwhelmed by
the number of lines on the page.

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.255
Direct labeling of data is another great
way to reduce this form of chartjunk.

25
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.690
But it's the third form of chartjunk
that I want to focus on here.

26
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.855
It's the one which typically comes to
mind when talking about chartjunk.

27
00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:46.410
Tufte calls this the duck.

28
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.009
Broadly, he's referring to
non-data creative graphics,

29
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.520
whether they be line art or photographs
and they're inclusion in the chart.

30
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.498
Newspapers and news magazines are a place
where this kind of imagery is often used.

31
00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:05.210
One well-known graphic artist,
Nigel Holmes, has used the duck to

32
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.300
display data in a way which is memorable
yet aesthetically interesting.

33
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.284
One of the most memorable images
he's created, to me, is entitled,

34
00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:16.454
Diamonds Were a Girl's Best Friend.

35
00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:19.760
And this showed up in
a Times Magazine in 1982.

36
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.935
This graphic shows the trend of the price
of diamonds from 1978 to 1982, and

37
00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:29.855
while the dollar amounts
are easily forgotten, it's easy

38
00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:33.845
to remember that the trend have a spike
because of the shape of the woman's leg.

39
00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.095
So is the doc really a useful heuristic,
or

40
00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:41.150
is it something about
docs which are memorable?

41
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.780
I was part of a team led by Scott Bateman

42
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.220
who wanted to understand
this issue in more detail.

43
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.720
So we set up some user testing.

44
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.610
I've linked the full academic
paper in this week's readings.

45
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.950
In short, we provided participants
a variety of homes as image,

46
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.810
including the one which you were shown,
which could be considered chartjunk.

47
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.910
We also included a variety of plain
graphs with high data-ink ratios,

48
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.610
with no decorative embellishments.

49
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.160
We brought 24 subjects
into the laboratory and

50
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.120
assigned them to either view the Holmes or
high data-ink ratio conditions.

51
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.980
We asked the subjects to describe and

52
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.980
summarize the charts with
a series of guided questions.

53
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.800
This was followed with a recall test,

54
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.920
both conducted immediately, as well as
a second test two to three weeks later.

55
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.510
Finally, we used eye tracking to determine
where subjects were paying attention

56
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.650
when they looked at these charts.

57
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.630
Our findings were interesting.

58
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.730
While there was no recall
difference when tested immediately,

59
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.900
recall after two to three weeks
was significantly better for

60
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.620
the Holmes Charts,
which showed the duck chartjunk.

61
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.824
Further subjects indicated subjectively
that the Holmes Charts were more

62
00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:52.025
enjoyable, more attractive,
easier to remember, and

63
00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:53.838
easier to remember details of.

64
00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:58.580
And they felt it was faster to describe
and remember the Holmes Charts.

65
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.480
The non-embellished designs didn't perform
better than any of the Holmes designs did.

66
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.550
Does this mean that you should use
embellishments in your charts?

67
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.600
Well, maybe.

68
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.480
I don't know of anyone who has
replicated our findings on a larger and

69
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.520
more diverse population, and there are
certainly other kinds of chartjunk, like

70
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.080
the unintended optical art in the grid
which seem like really good heuristics.

71
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.610
But I think there's more to be told in the
story and more nuance to be worked out.

72
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.440
At this point, you should have, at least,
some thoughts from designers as well as

73
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.110
from a user study on
specific kinds of charts.

74
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.640
And as you go about creating your
data science graphics, it's worth

75
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.760
not only reflecting on the principles you
use and the results you are sharing, but

76
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.664
also the process by which you
came up to create the graphics.

77
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.973
Setting up a user's study is much simpler
today with crowd sourcing services,

78
00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:51.300
such as CrowdFlower and
Amazon Mechanical Turk.

79
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.180
It's now very reasonable for the average
data scientist to test out whether

80
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.310
more embellished visuals
might be more effective.

81
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.930
Whether it's in terms of time,

82
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.835
memorability, accuracy
than those with data-ink.

83
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.270
In the next lecture, we're going to go on
to touch on two more items from Tufte,

84
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.900
the Lie Factor and sparklines.
