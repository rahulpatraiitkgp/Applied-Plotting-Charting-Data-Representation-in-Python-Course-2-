1
00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:09.990
A box plot.

2
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.980
Sometimes called a box-and-whisker
plot is a method of showing

3
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.690
aggregate statistics of various
samples in a concise matter.

4
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.180
The box plot simultaneously shows, for
each sample, the median of each value,

5
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.910
the minimum and maximum of the samples,
and the interquartile range.

6
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.490
Let's create three different
samplings from NumPy.

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.340
One for the normal distribution.

8
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.810
One for random.

9
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.409
And one from a gamma distribution.

10
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.800
Next, let's put those
in a pandas DataFrame.

11
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.040
After all, much of the data we would
actually process would come from pandas or

12
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.677
another data manipulation toolkit and
not from NumPy distribution functions.

13
00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:15.909
Now we can use the pandas described
function to see some summary statistics

14
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.200
about our data frame.

15
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.312
Each row has 10,000 entries.

16
00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.130
The mean values and
standard deviation vary heavily.

17
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.830
The minimal and

18
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.310
maximum values are showing, and
there's three different percentage values.

19
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.150
These percentage values make up what's
called the interquartile range.

20
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.050
There are four different
quarters of the data.

21
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.100
The first is between the minimal value and
the first 25% of the data.

22
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.960
And this value of 25% is
called the first quartile.

23
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.045
The second quarter of data is between
the 25% mark and the 50% of the data.

24
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:51.637
The third between 50 and 75% of the data.

25
00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:55.420
And 75% mark is called the third quartile.

26
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.650
And the final piece of data is between
the 75% and the maximum of the data.

27
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.690
Like standard deviation, the interquartile
range is a measure of variability of data.

28
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.668
And it's common to plot
this using a box plot.

29
00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:14.520
In a box plot, the mean, or the median,
of the data is plotted as a straight line.

30
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.630
Two boxes are formed, one above, which
represents the 50% to 75% data group,

31
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.590
and one below, which represents
the 25% to 50% data group.

32
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.420
Thin lines which are capped are then drawn
out to the minimum and maximum values.

33
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.900
Here's an example.

34
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.710
We'll create a new figure.

35
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.550
Then we call plt.boxplot, and we pass in
the column that we want to visualize.

36
00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:41.620
In matplotlib,
data needs to conform to NumPy arrays.

37
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.850
But pandas is built on top
of NumPy data points, so

38
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.680
this is as easy as projecting
the column that we're interested in.

39
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.508
Finally, we set the whis
parameter to be the range.

40
00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:58.072
This tells the box plot to set the whisker
values all the way out to the minimum and

41
00:02:58.072 --> 00:02:59.330
maximum values.

42
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.080
Also, I am going to assign the output
of the box plot function to a variable,

43
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.310
which is just an underscore.

44
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.260
Now this is either horrendous or
beautiful, depending on who you are.

45
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.150
You see, underscore is actually
a legal name for a variable on Python.

46
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.300
But it's also completely uninformative.

47
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.690
It's common practice by some to use an
underscore when unpacking values which you

48
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.810
don't care about and won't use later.

49
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.400
I am using it here because if we don't
assign the return value of plotting

50
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.160
function to a variable,

51
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.100
the Jupiter Notebook will assume
that we wanted to print that output.

52
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.860
Since plotting functions return
a list of all of the artists plotted,

53
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.260
this would really muddy up our display.

54
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.800
It's up to you whether you want
to use this underscore pattern or

55
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.760
not in your own code.

56
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.630
Great, this gives us a basic box plot.

57
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.170
Now let's add the other two samples to it.

58
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.550
Unfortunately we can't just pass a whole
pandas data frame to matplotlib.

59
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.532
Instead we need to pull out each column
and send them in as a list of values.

60
00:03:58.532 --> 00:04:03.890
All right,
that gives us our three distributions.

61
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.360
Now, we didn't normalize the scale,
so that's a little wonky.

62
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.810
But if we look at the gamma distribution,
for instance,

63
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.600
we see the tail of it is very, very long.

64
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.370
So the maximum values are very far out.

65
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.075
Let's take a look at this
by itself in a histogram.

66
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:29.707
Interesting, we see it starts
at a moderate level, spikes up,

67
00:04:29.707 --> 00:04:33.475
then drops off much more gradually and
does indeed have a very long tail.

68
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.550
Let's add this to our box plot.

69
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.090
Curiosity and to demonstrate
something called inset axes.

70
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.910
Recall that we have one
figure with one subplot.

71
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.140
Since we didn't do anything
fancy with subplots,

72
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.960
that means we only have one axes object.

73
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.310
We can actually overlay an axes on
top of another within a figure.

74
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.160
Now, this functionality isn't in
the basic matplotlib space, but

75
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.750
it's in the toolkits,
which tend to ship with matplotlib.

76
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.840
There are several different
toolkits available, and

77
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.000
while they tend to be packaged,
they aren't considered core.

78
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.178
The toolkit that we're going to
use is called the axes grid,

79
00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:15.442
and we import it from
the mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator.

80
00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:22.469
We create a new figure and
we put up our box plot.

81
00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:34.429
Then we just call the inset locator and
pass it the current axes object we want

82
00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:38.400
composition on top of,
followed by the size of our new axis.

83
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.260
And we can specify this
as both a width and

84
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.790
a height in percentage
from the parent axes.

85
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.100
Then we give it a number from the place
in which we wanted to drop the new axes.

86
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.100
This isn't quite as flexible as with grid
spec where we're essentially trying to

87
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.750
connect the plot to one of
ten different locations.

88
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.640
I'll put in position two here,

89
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.340
which will place the axes in
the upper left of the figure.

90
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.370
Then we just push a histogram to that
axes and it behaves as we would expect.

91
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.590
We've a little clash on the yaxis but

92
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.520
that's easy enough to
flip on the inset plot.

93
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.910
We just access the yaxis of the plot and
call tick_right.

94
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.080
And there we are.

95
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.370
An inset plot showing a distribution as
a histogram layered on top of a box plot.

96
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.160
Now, the box plot has a few more functions
which are worth investigating before we

97
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.410
finish this lecture off.

98
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.850
First, if you don't
supply the whis argument,

99
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.510
the whiskers actually only go out to
halfway between the interquartile range.

100
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.730
You can figure that out through the top of
the box minus the bottom of the box and

101
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.364
times that value by 1.5.

102
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.540
This is one method of detecting outliers.

103
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.690
And the points which are plotted
beyond the whiskers are called fliers.

104
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.720
You can see how this method of outlier
detection differs with respect to our

105
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.695
three distributions.

106
00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:04.395
You can also plot the confidence interval
in a couple of different ways on the data.

107
00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:08.685
The most common is to add notches to the
box plot representing the 95% confidence

108
00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:13.025
interval of the data and there are lots
of other ways to customize the box plot.

109
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.849
The box plot is one of the more
common plots that you might use as

110
00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:18.472
a data scientist.

111
00:07:19.492 --> 00:07:22.890
And matplotlib has significant support for
different kinds of box plots.

112
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.160
Here the matplotlib documentation is key.

113
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.150
You can find links in the course
resources to the API,

114
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.130
which describes the box
plot functionality.

115
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.130
I've got one more plot to show you.

116
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.570
A two dimensional histogram which
is better known as a heat map.

117
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.310
Then we'll look at a couple more
advance features of matplotlib.

118
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.750
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
