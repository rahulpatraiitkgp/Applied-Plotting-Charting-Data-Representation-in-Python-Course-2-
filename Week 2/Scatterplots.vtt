00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.958
In the previous lecture,
I introduced the plot function,

2
00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.800
which generates a series of lines which
get rendered against an axis object.

3
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.334
Matplotlib actually has a number of useful
plotting methods in the scripting layer

4
00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:23.916
which correspond to
different kinds of plots.

5
00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:25.840
We are not going to go
through all of them here but

6
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.320
we'll touch on a few of the major ones.

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.976
Regardless, there are a few things
to keep in mind which we learned in

8
00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:33.246
the previous lecture.

9
00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:37.926
One, pyplot is going to retrieve the
current figure with the function gcf and

10
00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:40.885
then get the current axis
with the function gca.

11
00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.290
Pyplot is keeping track of
the axis objects for you.

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.410
But don't forget that they're there and
we can get them when we want to get them.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.570
Two, also pyplot just mirrors
the API of the axis objects.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.180
So you can call the plot function
against the pyplot module.

15
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.090
But this is calling the axis plot
functions underneath, so be aware.

16
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.750
And three, finally, remember that
the function declaration from most

17
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.410
of the functions in matplotlib end
with an open set of keyword arguments.

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.340
There are a lot of different properties
you can control through these

19
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.600
keyword arguments.

20
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.840
And I'll start peppering in some of
them this week to demostrate that

21
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.180
the matplotlib documentation
isreally key in

22
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.640
gaining a full understanding
of the options available.

23
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.070
With that in mind let's move on
to talk first about scatterplots.

24
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.850
A scatterplot is a two dimensional plot
similar to the line plots I've shown.

25
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.695
The scatter function takes an x-axis
value as a first argument and

26
00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.530
y-axis value as the second.

27
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.420
If the two arguments are the same, we
get a nice diagonal alignment of points.

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.960
Let's do this now.

29
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.155
I'll bring in numpy as we're
going to use it later and

30
00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.883
matplotlib is really
based on numpy arrays.

31
00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:00.060
I'll create a short array for
x and make y the same.

32
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.600
Then create a new figure and scatterplot.

33
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.565
You can see in this plot
a nice diagonal line and

34
00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:09.890
matplotlib has sized
our axises accordingly.

35
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.480
Now, scatter doesn't
represent items as a series.

36
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.390
Instead, we can pass it a list of colors
which correspond to given points.

37
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.430
Let's use some list arithmetic to create a
new list just short of the number of data

38
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.600
points we need and
set all of the values to green.

39
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.501
Then we'll add a final value of red.

40
00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:44.357
Then we'll plot this, and

41
00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:48.130
we'll set the size of the data points to
100 to make it a little easier to see.

42
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.340
The separation of data points into lists,

43
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.230
which describes them as components is
a pretty common pattern in matplotlib.

44
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.040
You have some set of items, but

45
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.620
they're actually described as the same
slice across many different data sources.

46
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.420
It's in one object-based language, but
you might expect that each data point is

47
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.590
represented with its own instance,
which encapsulates all of its properties.

48
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.320
For instance, it's called an x value and
a y value and a color and a size.

49
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.148
That's not the case here.

50
00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:22.990
This is where it's useful to have some
knowledge of list comprehensions and

51
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.540
lambdas as we talked about
in the first course.

52
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.236
Also important is the zip function and
list unpacking.

53
00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:33.396
And because this is so
common in the Python data science world,

54
00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:36.270
I'm going to take a brief aside and
talk about that here.

55
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.600
Recall that the zip method
takes a number of iterables and

56
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.980
creates tuples out of them,
matching elements based on index.

57
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.270
So if we have two lists of numbers,
zip will take the first from each and

58
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.540
create a tuple, then the second from
each and create a tuple, and so on.

59
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.770
Also remember that zip has lazy evaluation
because it's actually a generator

60
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.150
in Python 3 which means we
need to use the list function

61
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.460
if we want to see the results
of iterating over zip.

62
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.480
Let's demonstrate.

63
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.060
Here we'll create a new zip
generator with a zip function

64
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.140
passing in two lists of numbers.

65
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.932
When we convert this generator to a list,
we see there's a list of pairwise tuples.

66
00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:24.210
Storing point data as tuples is common and

67
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.770
you should be familiar with being able
to convert data to and from this form.

68
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.630
If we want to turn the data back into
two lists, one with the x component and

69
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.520
one with the y component,
we can use parameter unpacking with zip.

70
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.430
When you pass a list or an interval
more generally to a function and

71
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.310
prepend it with an asterisk,
each item is taken out of the iterable and

72
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.779
passed as a separate argument.

73
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.040
So we can do that here, passing into
a new zip function five parameters,

74
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.840
each of length two.

75
00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.220
Zip will then create a new two value list
which is identical to our original x and

76
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.020
y values.

77
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.490
If we want to get even fancier,

78
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.620
we can unpack this result into
two variables directly, x and y.

79
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.190
So that's a brief aside
on a variable tool.

80
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.580
When it comes to manipulating and
cleaning data in the wild.

81
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.090
Now, let's get back to plotting.

82
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.920
Let's take these two lists and
plot them to a new figure using scatter.

83
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.560
Instead of plotting them as one data
series, we'll slice the lists and

84
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.820
plot them as two data series.

85
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.620
You'll note that we can color each series
with a single value if we want to.

86
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.660
We can also do things
like change the color or

87
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.830
transparency of an entire series,
or individual data points as well.

88
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.320
Finally, we have the ability to label
the data series, and I'll do that now.

89
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.762
This will come in handy later
when building a legend.

90
00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:54.216
Now before we leave the scatter plot,

91
00:05:54.216 --> 00:05:57.035
let's talk a bit more about
the properties of axis.

92
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.330
The axis generally have labels to them
to explain what they represent or

93
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.460
the units that they describe.

94
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.700
Charts tend to have titles as well,
so let's put this in place now.

95
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.110
Since pyplot mirrors much of the axis API,
we can make calls directly on pyplot.

96
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.332
Let's do this now, adding in an xlabel,
a ylabel, and then a title.

97
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.380
And let's add a legend as well.

98
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.700
You'll see that matplotlib places this
in the upper left hand corner and

99
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.920
puts a little visual about
our data series there.

100
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.630
In the docs for the legend, you'll see
that there are a number of different

101
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.210
parameters and one of them is called lock.

102
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.095
And a value of 4, we'll put it in
the lower right hand corner of the axis.

103
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.957
We could also get rid of the frame and
add a title, and

104
00:06:57.957 --> 00:07:00.164
do any number of different
transformations.

105
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:06.610
The legend itself is an artist,
which means it can contain children.

106
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.910
Let's take advantage of this and

107
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.050
write a little routine to recursively go
through the list of children in an artist.

108
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.782
First, we'll import the artist
class from matplotlib.

109
00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:19.990
Then we'll make a recursive function
which takes in an artist and

110
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.610
some depth parameter.

111
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.131
Then checks if the object is an artist and
if so, prints out its string name.

112
00:07:33.974 --> 00:07:37.310
Then recurses and
increases the depth for pretty printing.

113
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.240
Finally, we can call this on
the legend object itself.

114
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.492
So you can see the legend artist is
just made up of a number of different

115
00:07:48.492 --> 00:07:52.944
offsetboxes for drawing,
as well as TextAreas and PathCollections.

116
00:07:58.367 --> 00:08:02.164
What I want you to take away from this is
that there is nothing magical about what

117
00:08:02.164 --> 00:08:03.840
matplotlib is doing.

118
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.030
Calls to the scripting interface,
just create figures, subplots, and axis.

119
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.478
Then load those axis up
with various artists,

120
00:08:10.478 --> 00:08:14.600
which the back-end renders to the screen
or some other medium like a file.

121
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.570
While you'll spend 95% of your time at the
scripting layer, happily creating graphs

122
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.600
and charts, it's important to understand
how the library works underneath for

123
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.890
the other 5% of the time.

124
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.570
And the time that you will use this is
when you really want to have control over

125
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.110
and to create your own charting functions,
and

126
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.700
you'll have a chance to do that
by the end of this course.

127
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.740
In the next lecture,
we'll go back into line plots and

128
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.650
create a few more then onto bar charts.
