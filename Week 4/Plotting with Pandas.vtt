00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:11.302
Hi everyone, welcome to today's tutorial,

2
00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:14.420
where we will be looking
at visualization in pandas.

3
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.440
pandas uses matplotlib under the hood, and
provides some convenient functions for

4
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.310
visualizing data.

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.540
Before we dive into
visualization in pandas,

6
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.710
lets take a look at
the matplotlib's style package.

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.880
Matplotlib comes with a number
of predefined styles,

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.980
which we can choose from,
to change the default look of our plots.

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.240
Because pandas is using
matplotlib under the hood,

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.950
this will change the default style
of our pandas graphs as well.

11
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.910
We can use plt.style.available to
see the predefined styles provided.

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.459
Let's use the seaborn-colorblind style,
which will change the default colors of

13
00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:00.074
our plots to use a color palette that is
more color vision deficiency friendly.

14
00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:08.199
Now, where the built-in visualization
of pandas really shines is in

15
00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:11.385
helping with fast and
easy plotting of series and

16
00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.440
DataFrames that can help
us explore the data.

17
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.020
Let's make a DataFrame.

18
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.520
First, we'll set the seed for

19
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.820
the random number generator,
which will allow us to reproduce the data.

20
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.750
Next, let's add three columns
of random time series data.

21
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.610
We can generate the random data by
cumulatively summing up random numbers.

22
00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:36.992
numpi has a great function for this called
cumsum, which cumulatively sums an array

23
00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:42.520
Let's do this for
three columns, A, B and C.

24
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.055
And also offset the B column by + 20 and
the C column by- 20.

25
00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:53.921
Using date_range, we can set
the index to be everyday in 2017.

26
00:01:56.647 --> 00:02:01.204
Now let's see what this data looks like a
little more visually to plot this data we

27
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.565
can use the plot method on the DataFrame.

28
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.102
The plot method on series and DataFrame
is just a simple wrapper around plt.plot.

29
00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:11.885
So when we call df.plot,

30
00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:16.439
we get a line graph of all the columns
in the data frame with labels.

31
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.600
Notice how the colors are slightly
different from the default matplotlib

32
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.710
colors because of the style we used.

33
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.550
Also, notice this cool
Jupyter Notebook trick.

34
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.207
If you add a semicolon to
the end of the plotting call,

35
00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:32.108
this will suppress unwanted output.

36
00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:34.627
And this works with regular matplotlib,
too.

37
00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:42.120
DataFrame.plot allows us to plot
a number of different kinds of plots.

38
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.750
We can select which plot we want to use
by pressing it into the kind parameter.

39
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.190
Let's try and create a scatter plot
that takes the A and B columns of df.

40
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.839
We pass in scatter to the kind
parameter to change the plot type.

41
00:02:59.602 --> 00:03:02.890
This is what we'd get if we
called plt.plot on the A and

42
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.550
B columns with the point marker parameter.

43
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.980
Passing scatter into
the kind keyword argument

44
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.870
changed the plot to a scatterplot.

45
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.075
You can also choose the plot
kind by using the methods

46
00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:22.270
dataframe.plot.kind instead of
providing the kind keyword argument.

47
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.370
Now let's try this and
create something a little more complex.

48
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.237
This time we want to make a scatterplot
with points varying in color and size.

49
00:03:32.237 --> 00:03:38.070
We'll use df.plot.scatter,
pass in columns A and C.

50
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.960
And set the color C and size S to
change based on the value of column B.

51
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.890
Finally, we can choose
the color palette used

52
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.310
by passing a string into
the parameter color map.

53
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.540
Here, I'll use viridis,
which is particularly pleasing to the eye.

54
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.109
Here we can see the A and
C columns plotted against one another with

55
00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.955
the size and color changing based
on the values of the B column.

56
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:13.025
Because df.plot.scatter returns
a matplotlib.axes._subplot, we can perform

57
00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:18.520
modification on this object just like
objects returned by matplotlib plots.

58
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.110
For example, let's see what it looks
like when we change the aspect ratio of

59
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.131
the AxesSubplot to equal.

60
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.250
Setting the aspect ratio to equal allows
the viewer to easily see that the range of

61
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.579
series A is much smaller than series C.

62
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:49.528
Using pandas, we can also easily
do box plots, Histograms,

63
00:04:53.933 --> 00:05:00.690
And kernel density estimate plots.
Which are useful for 
visualizing an estimate of a variable's

64
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.649
probability density function.

65
00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:05.213
Kernel density estimation plots come in
handy in data science application

66
00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:11.481
where you want to derive a smooth continuous
function from a given sample.

67
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:14.978
Pandas also has plotting tools that help
with visualizing large amounts of data or

68
00:05:15.963 --> 00:05:17.108
high dimensional data.

69
00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:22.380
Let's explore a couple of these tools
by loading in the iris flower data set.

70
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.940

71
00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:36.012
The iris data set is a classic
multivariate data set,

72
00:05:36.012 --> 00:05:38.208
which includes the sepal length,
sepal width, petal length, and
petal width 

73
00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:40.710
for hundreds of samples
of three species of the iris flower.

74
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.760
pandas has a plotting tool that allows
us to create a scatter matrix from a DataFrame.

75
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.270
A scatter matrix is a way of
comparing each column in a DataFrame

76
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.730
to every other column
in a pairwise fashion.

77
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.860
Let's use it to visualize
the iris dataframe and

78
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.930
see what insights we
can gain from our data.

79
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.330
The scatter matrix creates scatter plots
between the different variables and

80
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.630
histograms along the diagonals.

81
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.370
This allows us to quickly see some of
the more obvious patterns in the data set.

82
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.730
Looking at the scatter plots, it appears
that there are some distinct groupings of

83
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.635
the points, which might indicate that
there could be some clustering going on.

84
00:06:20.635 --> 00:06:23.830
And while this looks impressive and

85
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.790
is certainly useful, realize that in
the last two weeks you have gained all of

86
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.830
the skills to manually build these
kinds of plots if you want to.

87
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.740
This is nothing more than a four
by four grid of subplots,

88
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.170
with some plots histograms and
the others scatterplots.

89
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.089
Let's look at one more plotting tool
in pandas which will help us visualize

90
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.460
multivariate data.

91
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.430
pandas includes a plotting tool for
creating parallel coordinates plots.

92
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.260
Parallel coordinate plots are a common
way of visualizing high dimensional multivariate data.

93
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.075
Each variable in the data set
corresponds to an equally

94
00:06:58.075 --> 00:06:59.364
spaced parallel vertical line.

95
00:06:59.364 --> 00:07:02.726
The values of each variable are then
connected by lines between for

96
00:07:02.726 --> 00:07:04.780
each individual observation.

97
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.760

98
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.270
Coloring the lines by class,
in this example the species of flower,

99
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.580
allows the viewer to more easily
see any patterns or clustering.

100
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.030
For instance, looking at our iris data
set, we can see that the petal length and

101
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.160
petal width are two variables that split
the different species fairly clearly.

102
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.070
With iris virginica having the longest and
widest petals.

103
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.970
And iris setosa having the shortest and
narrowest petals.

104
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.070
Well that's it for
visualization in pandas.

105
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.820
In the next video, we'll look at Seaborn,
a powerful package for statistical plotting.
