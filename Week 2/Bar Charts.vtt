00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:12.510
Matplotlib has support for
several kinds of bar charts.

2
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.520
The most general case, we plot a bar
chart by sending in a parameter

3
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.740
of the x components, and
a parameter of the height of the bar.

4
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.930
Let's do this with our linear data.

5
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.840
Here I'm going to just create a list of
values as long as our linear data list.

6
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.620
Then, we'll send this along with
the linear data's bar heights,

7
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.180
to the bar function.

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.109
We pass in the width of the bar as 0.3.

9
00:00:45.428 --> 00:00:49.387
To add a second bar, we simply call
the bar plot again with new data,

10
00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:53.209
keeping in mind that we need to
adjust the x component to make up for

11
00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:54.763
the first bar we plotted.

12
00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:03.271
Of course, we'll throw this bar in as red.

13
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.230
So the plot looks okay, but not great.

14
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.520
All of the x labels are to the far
left of the items being described, and

15
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.000
not centered.

16
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.100
Now, we can center them with a given bar,
using the align parameter, but

17
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.880
it's a bit frustrating when you
have to make multiple bars, and

18
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.260
you have to calculate it yourself.

19
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.950
And it's a pain to go through and
add a new data series manually.

20
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.790
And this gets worse, we actually
have to manually iterate through and

21
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.080
add in dates if we want them.

22
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.640
Because otherwise we couldn't set
the bar left location appropriately.

23
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.750
I'll be honest,

24
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.900
bar charts are one of my least favorite
things to create in matplotlib.

25
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.550
I feel like the foundation is there,

26
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.300
but some of the ways I
would want to use the API,

27
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.940
such as plotting several series of data
in groups across time, are sadly missing.

28
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.470
There are some other nice
features of bar charts, though.

29
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.050
For instance, you can add error
bars to each bar as well,

30
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.590
using the y-error parameter.

31
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.250
For example, each of our pieces of data in
the linear data might actually be a mean

32
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.950
value, computed from many
different observations.

33
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.720
So we could just create
a list of error values.

34
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.050
I'll import from a random function which
can generate some random integers, and

35
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.890
then I'll use a list comprehension
to generate this new list.

36
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.505
Then we could just call plt.bar again,
and see our new data appear.

37
00:02:38.428 --> 00:02:41.740
We can also do stacked bar charts as well.

38
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.814
For instance, if we wanted to show
cumulative values while also keeping

39
00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:50.155
the series independent, we could do
this by setting the bottom parameter and

40
00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:53.251
our second plot to be equal
to first set of data to plot.

41
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:22.955
Finally, we can pivot this bar graph
into a horizontal bar graph by calling

42
00:03:22.955 --> 00:03:24.825
the barh function instead.

43
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.373
But note that we have to change the bottom
to a left and the width to a height.

44
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:51.355
So those are the basics of charting and
plotting in Matplotlib.

45
00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:54.315
I think it's important to realize
that there really isn't any magic.

46
00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:57.955
The scripting layer is really
a set of convenience functions

47
00:03:57.955 --> 00:03:59.305
on top of the object layer.

48
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.890
Some people share a preference for
one or the other, but at the core,

49
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.370
they manipulate the same data elements.

50
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.990
And I don't think you should think of
them as being opposed to one another or

51
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.060
duplicative.

52
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.769
They work together, and being able to
move back and forth is really important.

53
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.000
We've talked about some
fundamental charts in this module.

54
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.760
Scatter plots, line graphs,
and bar charts.

55
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.980
There are more,
which we'll dig into in the next module.

56
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.180
But these are a good basis.

57
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.050
The assignment for
this module is a tough one.

58
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.050
It's meant to show you real world
data visualization problems.

59
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.930
You're going to have to lever your
knowledge of the Pandas Library from

60
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.300
the first course and

61
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.120
couple this with your new knowledge of
Matplotlib to come to an elegant solution.

62
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.660
But the final result should
be a portfolio ready piece.

63
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.230
So I'll see you in the forums for
discussions and for help.
