00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:12.601
Welcome to the second module in
the course Applied Plotting, Charting and

2
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.226
Data Representation in Python.

3
00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:17.036
In the first module, we touched on
the some of the fundamentals of

4
00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:19.480
putting together good
information graphics.

5
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.750
Drawing on influential thinkers in
the field, such Alberto Cairo and

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.360
Edward Tufte.

7
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.700
In this module, we're going to pivot and
focus on skills for

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.440
building basic charts using
the Python based Matplotlib tool kit.

9
00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:38.210
Matplotlib is a powerful open source tool
kit for representing and visualizing data.

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.110
Its creator, John Hunter,
was heavily inspired

11
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.300
by the MATLAB programming environment and
borrows many of these elements.

12
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.270
Matplotlib can be a bit confusing
to learn from web resources.

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.974
There's a traditional object-oriented API,
but

14
00:00:52.974 --> 00:00:55.499
there's also a MATLAB-like
scripting model.

15
00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:59.708
And I've found that it's not always clear
why a given script from a blog post might

16
00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:00.630
work or not work.

17
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.720
I'm going to try and
demystify this a bit for

18
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.360
you by providing a structured
introduction to the toolkit.

19
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.800
After the architecture introduction,

20
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.100
we're going to dive right into
creating charts and graphs.

21
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.665
In this module, we're going to focus
on some of the basics, scatter plots,

22
00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:19.558
line graphs, and bar charts.

23
00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:23.307
We're also going to touch on how to
label pieces of your charts to improve

24
00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:26.883
readability, and draw the user's
attention to specific details.

25
00:01:26.883 --> 00:01:30.557
And how to manipulate data elements
in a plotting environment.

26
00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.907
From here on out there
will be fewer lectures and

27
00:01:32.907 --> 00:01:36.980
more emphasis on the module will be put
on the plotting and charting assignments.

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.260
At the end of modules two, three and four,
you should be able to produce publication

29
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.890
quality charts and
figures using a breadth of data.

30
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.390
Let's dive in.
