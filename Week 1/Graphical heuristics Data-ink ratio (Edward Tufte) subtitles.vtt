00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:13.053
Edward Tufte is a seminal figure on how
to design visual displays of quantitative

2
00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:13.869
information.

3
00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.327
In fact, this is the title of
my favorite book of his, and

4
00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:21.030
I highly encourage you
to check out his work.

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.920
In this book, he introduces two
interesting graphical heuristics,

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.910
the data-ink ratio and chart junk.

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.090
First, what's a heuristic?

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.390
A heuristic is a process or rule that is
meant to guide you in decision making.

9
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.120
Is by definition not known to be optimal
or perfect, but to be practical in nature.

10
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.050
Heuristics are meant to be followed until
you've a reason to deviate from them.

11
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.933
Tufte's first graphical
heuristic is data-ink ratio.

12
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:52.350
Tufte defines data-ink as
the non-erasable core of a graphic.

13
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.550
The non-redundant ink arranged in response
to variation in the numbers represented.

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.210
In other words, the data-ink is essential
to the sense-making process for

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.130
a given variable.

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.330
Tufte defines the data-ink
ratio as the amount of data-ink

17
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.060
divided by the total ink
required to print the graphic.

18
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.610
Now I don't think that he's actually
suggesting we measure the amount of ink

19
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.530
laid down on the page, but
instead is suggesting that we remove those

20
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.500
elements which don't add new
information to the graphic.

21
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.764
Perhaps one of the best known examples
showing data-ink reduction was done by

22
00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:31.964
Darkhorse Analytics,
an information, visualization, and

23
00:01:31.964 --> 00:01:35.440
design company in Edmonton,
Alberta, Canada.

24
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.890
They've put together four examples of
how the data-ink ratio can be approved.

25
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.230
And I'm going to link to those
in the next reading assignment.

26
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.390
But I'm going to walk through
the first one of those here.

27
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.040
We start with the table of
the data about food items and

28
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.550
the number of calories in those items.

29
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.660
The first step is to remove
unwanted background imagery

30
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.990
since it provides no value
to understanding the chart.

31
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.558
We also remove the gray background
behind the bars since it provides no

32
00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:03.588
conceptual value.

33
00:02:03.588 --> 00:02:07.210
Then we get rid of
the redundancy throughout.

34
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.820
This includes getting rid of the legend,

35
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.965
since each bar is labeled
directly along the x-axis.

36
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.860
The title in the y-axis labels are
trimmed, since there's plenty of reference

37
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.770
throughout the image to this being
about calories for food items.

38
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.290
This leaves us with a much smaller image.

39
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.130
There are some heavy lines forming
borders which add no value, so

40
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.280
we can remove them too.

41
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.581
Color is a tricky item to
include in charts and graphs.

42
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:37.950
We won't be going into depth on
color theory in this course.

43
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.130
But color is a challenge when trying
to engage with persons who might

44
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.260
be color vision deficient or color blind.

45
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.090
There are some tactics to work around.

46
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.660
For instance, it used to be best practice
to replace coloration with patterns,

47
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.560
sometimes called hatching in graphics.

48
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.080
This brings its own challenges,
which we'll see in a bit.

49
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.920
Instead, the solution is almost always
to remove all color, except for

50
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.740
one which you can use as emphasis and
link to that color in your text.

51
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.290
Someone then viewing a chart out of
context would still get the sense

52
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.510
of emphasis without being
overwhelmed by a rainbow of data.

53
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.300
So let's drop colors except for bacon,

54
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.971
with the presumption that this text
is clearly referenced in the data.

55
00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:23.170
Three-dimensional bars and

56
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.680
drop shadows can go as well,
since these don't add extra value.

57
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.569
We could also drop the bolding throughout.

58
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.675
There's still a lot of gridwork
left in this image and

59
00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:36.552
it's a bit unclear what the value of this
gridwork is, so we're going to drop it.

60
00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:41.760
Now grids can be valuable, but
they're often just a distraction.

61
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760
For the moment though, study the image.

62
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.117
What's the difference in the number
of calories between bacon,

63
00:03:47.117 --> 00:03:50.546
our data point of interest, and
say, potato chips or chili dogs?

64
00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:55.469
Just removing the lines doesn't
make it easier to read.

65
00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.160
But the values of the data
are pretty simple here.

66
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.110
So let's directly label
each bar in the graphic.

67
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.070
Now, how big is the difference
between bacon and

68
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.190
potato chips or bacon and chili dogs?

69
00:04:09.402 --> 00:04:13.039
Certainly, you have to do a bit of math,
but you can still get a quick estimate by

70
00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.865
glancing at the graphic, and an exact
value through comparing numbers directly.

71
00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:19.660
And there you have it.

72
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.660
By increasing the data-ink ratio, we have
made the graphic not only simpler and

73
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.290
more readable, but increased the amount
of information the viewer sees.

74
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.490
I encourage you to check out the other
examples from Darkhorse Analytics

75
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.170
linked in the next reading.

76
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.390
As they've done this clean up for

77
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.640
a variety of different
visuals including maps.

78
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.650
We'll continue our exploration of Tufte's
heuristics by looking at chart junk

79
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.500
in the next lecture.
