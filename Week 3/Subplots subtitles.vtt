1
00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:12.939
In module one, we talked about principles,
which underly good visualizations,

2
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.690
we pulled from work by Cairo and Tufty.

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.530
In Module 2, we opened up
the Matplotlib Python Library.

4
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.000
Starting with the architecture and

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.140
working our way through some
the most common kinds of plots.

6
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.240
Scatter plots, line graphs and bar charts.

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.710
In this module,
we're going to do a bit deeper and

8
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.490
talk about multiple plots with the same
figure, interaction, animation and

9
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.290
a few more kinds of plots which you might
find useful in your data science journey.

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.900
Now, if you've been
doing these assignments,

11
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.120
you've undoubtedly been visiting
our course discussion forms,

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.150
going to stack overflow, and reading
the map plot live API documentation.

13
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.190
I want to point you to
the Matplotlib mailing list as well

14
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.540
is another great resource.

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.700
There would be resource posted
below on how to browse that list.

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.030
It's pretty common with open source
projects to have two mailing lists.

17
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.450
One for developers and
the other for users.

18
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.030
The users place is where most of
the question answering happens.

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.850
But I encourage to you look at
the developer archives, too.

20
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.360
To get an idea as to what these kind of
projects look like behind the scenes.

21
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.580
Let's start this module with
a deeper look at subplots.

22
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.820
Thus far we have been using a signal axis
object to plot a single graph or figure.

23
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.960
Sometimes it is useful to show
two complex plot side by side for

24
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.745
the viewer to compare.

25
00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:34.300
Matplotlib handles this
with a single figure.

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.480
Let's first set our rendering
backend to the NPA backend,

27
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.010
then import our pyplot module and
NumPy, as we'll need then both.

28
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.360
If we look at the subplot documentation,

29
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.080
we see that the first argument
is the number of rows,

30
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.370
the second the number of columns,
and the third is the plot number.

31
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.770
In matplotlib, a conceptual grid
is overlayed on the figure.

32
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.460
And a subplot command allows you to create
axis to different portions of this grid.

33
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.580
For instance, if we want to to
create two plots side by side,

34
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.810
we would call subplot with
the parameters 1, 2, and 1.

35
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.240
This would allow us to use 1 row,
with 2 columns, and

36
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.755
set the first axis to be the current axis.

37
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.670
This.
Let's do this now.

38
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.870
We'll create a new figure and then a new
subplot with one row and two columns.

39
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.410
And we'll ask for the left hand side axis.

40
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.530
The greatest number alternatively
from left to right and top to bottom.

41
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.830
So subsequent calls to plot would
create the left hand side plot.

42
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.100
Okay, great we've got a skinny
plot on the left hand side.

43
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.081
We can then call subplot again with the
last parameter as a two to plot new data

44
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:45.943
to a plot on the right hand side.

45
00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:58.375
And that's nice.

46
00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.955
Now we have two plots,
each with their own axis objects.

47
00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:05.625
Now the norm with matplotlib
is that you store the axis

48
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:08.570
object that you get back from the subplot.

49
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.376
But you can call subplot again.

50
00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.820
At any time with the parameters
that interest you

51
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.630
in order to get back a given axis.

52
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.887
Here, let's put exponential
on the linear graph 2

53
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.118
This demonstrates a common problem,

54
00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:37.725
it looked like linear had roughly the same
area under the line on the chart until we

55
00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:40.890
asked matplotlib to put
them into one graph.

56
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.730
Then the y axis was refreshed.

57
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.960
There would be a big problem with
misleading the reader if we didn't find

58
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.080
a way to lock axis between two plots.

59
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.130
When you create a new subplot you
are able to share the x, y, or

60
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.640
both axis using the share x and
share y parameters.

61
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.440
Here's how we could clean this up,
we create a new figure.

62
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.660
Then created a subplot on
the left-hand side store it in AX1.

63
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.060
After plotting that data we create
the axis on the right-hand side,

64
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.560
and we indicate explicitly
we want to share the y-axis.

65
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.270
Now we don't have to store the subplot
to a variable like we did with AX1.

66
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.020
Remember that when you use the scripting
interface, high plot is going to get

67
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.330
the current axis object with GCA or
get current axis underneath.

68
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.770
So a call to pipeplot.plot
will transparently work with

69
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.810
the last axis objects that we're using.

70
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.110
There we go.

71
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.725
Two plots side by side and
we've locked the y axis.

72
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.530
Now, those of you who have been playing
close attention will note that I used

73
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.330
the add subplot function
in the last module.

74
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.890
But I didn't pass in three parameters,
just one.

75
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.820
The maplotlib developers allow you to
specify the row, columns, and number

76
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.865
of the plot that you want with either
three parameters or a single parameter.

77
00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:03.210
Where the hundreds values the first
argument, the tens the second argument,

78
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.480
and the ones the third argument.

79
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.230
So we will call subplot with three
parameters, one, two, and one.

80
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.490
And the axis that return
should be equal to 1,

81
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.680
which is created with the 1 parameter,
121.

82
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.950
I'm frankly not a big fan
of this second syntax.

83
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.863
It feels pretty hacky and it really
only saves typing two commas and yet

84
00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:26.796
limits us to single digit radius.

85
00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:32.407
Now computer science folks might
feel a little twitch inside

86
00:05:32.407 --> 00:05:34.820
like something's wrong with this notation.

87
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.090
And I'll say that it certainly bugged
me the first few times I saw it.

88
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.720
An important fact to remember is that
the plot location in the matrix of items

89
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.640
is index starting at one and

90
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.050
not at zero, as would be the convention
if you were using something like NumPy.

91
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.070
So if you're iterating through a matrix or
list, create subplots.

92
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.460
Remember to start at position plus one.

93
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.981
Now, there's a nice function
called subplots, note the plural,

94
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.960
which allows you to get many axis objects
at once, and I think this is great.

95
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.483
So, if we wanted to get a three by
three grid with all of the axis x and

96
00:06:10.483 --> 00:06:12.940
y ranges locked, we can do so like this.

97
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.730
The syntax looks a little goofy
maybe since we're unpacking

98
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.540
the results of the subplots
function directly.

99
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.180
Wherein it's an effective way to build
a grid where everything shares an axis.

100
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.830
And of course, you could just
return the tuple of plots and

101
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.459
iterate it over if you wanted to.

102
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.470
The results however look really nice.

103
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.730
Note that this method turns off the y and
x labels except for

104
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.490
those plots which are on the left hand
side or the bottom of the figure.

105
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.520
If you want to turn the labels back on,

106
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.660
you need to iterate through the axis
objects and do it yourself.

107
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.920
You could do this directly through
the axis objects you have or

108
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.510
iterate through all the axis objects
in the figure and change the x and

109
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.150
y tick labels to be visible.

110
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.560
Unfortunately, on the notebook
backend on my installation,

111
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.010
this doesn't redraw the figure.

112
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.940
But you can force the figure to redraw
by calling the canvas draw function.

113
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.960
Remember you can get the current figure
at any time using pyplots gcf or

114
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.420
get current figure or function.

115
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.280
Okay, so those are the basics
of subplots and matplotlib.

116
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.870
You can see that you can leverage
everything you learned to the last

117
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.605
module with this new knowledge to create
figures which have rich subplots.

118
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.050
In the next module, I want to exploit
this while introducing you to pretty

119
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.730
fundamental data science chart,
the histogram.
