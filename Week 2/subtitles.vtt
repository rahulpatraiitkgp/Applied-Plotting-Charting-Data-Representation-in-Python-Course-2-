00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:12.210
In this lecture, I want to walk you
through the process of taking a regular

2
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.711
Matplotlib plot and applying Tufte's
principles of data-ink ratio and

3
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.870
char junk to make it
just a little bit better.

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.463
I'm going to walk through all of
the steps using the Jupiter notebooks and

5
00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:24.098
you're welcome to follow along.

6
00:00:24.098 --> 00:00:27.754
But if you want a bit more of a challenge,
I'll be including in video

7
00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:32.003
quizzes along the way which prompts you
to solve the problem before I address.

8
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:33.370
This is good practice.

9
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.910
The video will pause and
you can do a quick Google to try and

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.100
find an appropriate API for
solving a specific issue.

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.680
You can try it out in the system, then you
can compare it to my solution right after.

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.390
Let's get started.

13
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.030
We use a plot of data on the popularity of

14
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.320
programming languages
taken from stack overflow.

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.060
Here there are five different languages,
Python, SQL, Java, C++, and JavaScript.

16
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.983
We'll find their positions as a rank
using NumPy as a range function.

17
00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:05.074
And here are the popularity
values from stack overflow.

18
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.334
We'll create a bar chart based on rank and
popularity, then add x and y ticks and

19
00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:13.460
set a title.

20
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.060
Then when we call plot.show,
the figure will render.

21
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.110
Okay, here's the first challenge.

22
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.692
The tics along both axis are annoying and
sort of clutter the document up a bit.

23
00:01:23.692 --> 00:01:27.040
And the labels on the y axis
really should be direct.

24
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.859
So let's remove all of these.

25
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.559
I use the tic param's method of plot
to turn them all off except for

26
00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:37.400
the bottom label.

27
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.260
It's nice to have a single function
which can handle all of this.

28
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.840
Now our plot still has
this frame around it, but

29
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.890
it's not really necessary and
it seems a little heavyweight.

30
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.075
Let's remove that ink.

31
00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:54.992
This is a bit more involved, but
we can get the current axis,

32
00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:59.360
then iterate through all the spine,
setting their visibility to false.

33
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.220
Already, this chart looks
much more lightweight.

34
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.120
Now, the blue is okay,

35
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.310
but it doesn't really help us
differentiate between the bars at all.

36
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.960
How about we soften all of
the hard blacks to gray,

37
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.880
then we change the bar
colors to gray as well.

38
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.953
Also, let's keep the Python bar
the same color of blue that

39
00:02:15.953 --> 00:02:17.987
it was originally to make it stand out.

40
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.160
Okay, so there are several different
ways that we could do this.

41
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.170
The way I chose was to add
an alpha parameter to everything,

42
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.850
which adds a bit of transparency and
softens the colors up a bit.

43
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.610
I also set the bars themselves to
a neutral gray color then chose

44
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.890
a nice blue from the Python website
to accentuate the first bar.

45
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.790
Of course, we've actually made the chart
a little bit less accurate right

46
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.090
now since we don't have any y labels.

47
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.670
Let's fix this and
remove the y axis label and

48
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.320
just directly label the individual bars.

49
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.351
We don't really need the y axis label,
since the title tells

50
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.333
us everything we need to know
about the units in this chart.

51
00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:03.500
Removing the label is easy, but changing
the bars is a little bit of a pain.

52
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.020
For this we want to iterate over each
of the bars and grab its height.

53
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.159
Then we want to create a new text
object with the data information.

54
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.015
Unfortunately, this means doing
a little bit of playing with padding.

55
00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:18.917
Here I'll set up the x location to the bar
x plus the width divided by two and

56
00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:22.017
the y location to be
the bar height minus five.

57
00:03:22.017 --> 00:03:25.213
It might seem weird to get the middle
of the bar in the x dimension, but

58
00:03:25.213 --> 00:03:28.705
that's because I'm setting the label
to center itself, horizontally.

59
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.100
And that's all there is to it.

60
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.423
A simple series of steps to make your
bar charts little bit more usable.

61
00:03:37.423 --> 00:03:40.424
You could find a full notebook for
this example and

62
00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:42.935
the course [INAUDIBLE] system directory.

63
00:03:42.935 --> 00:03:46.335
When you were looking at this,
did you find a different way to do things?

64
00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:50.024
Or do you think there's other places that
we could go to make this more readable and

65
00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:52.080
increase the improvements?

66
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.830
Feel free to go into the discussion
forums and share them with me and

67
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.490
