1
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.145
I consider Alberto Cairo's book,

2
00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:15.070
The Truthful Art to be required
reading for any data scientist.

3
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.322
In one book, he has managed to pack in
a plethora of references to experts in

4
00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:24.400
the field while still distilling
down details into memorable lessons.

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.486
While we won't have an opportunity
to cover everything he talks about.

6
00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:31.710
I want to talk in this lecture about the
foundation of the book in particular which

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.140
is a five part frame work for considering
the qualities of an information graphic.

8
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.470
Importantly, Cairo says that these
qualities are not independent of one

9
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.690
another and that they're interrelated.

10
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.000
So while I tend to be prone to
reductionism, keep in mind that

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.510
the different qualities interact with one
another as we go through the lecture.

12
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.450
The first quality of a good
visualization is that it's truthful.

13
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.686
Now Cairo admits that truth could
be considered subjective and

14
00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:03.914
it's certainly on a continuum with some
things being more truthful than others.

15
00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:06.890
And then it might be impossible
to establish an absolute truth.

16
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.720
But as data scientists,

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.670
he argues, we have two obligations
when it comes to protecting the truth.

18
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.774
First, we have to be honest with ourselves
when we clean and summarize data.

19
00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:22.482
Are the activities we're engaging in
likely to obscure a message because

20
00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.490
of the limitations that we've applied?

21
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.248
We should consider explicitly each
modification that we're making to

22
00:01:29.248 --> 00:01:29.817
the data.

23
00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:32.600
And make sure we are practicing
what he calls self deception.

24
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.160
Skepticism is an important skill for
data scientist.

25
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.590
And we often get so focus on looking for
patterns that we reduce or

26
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.800
present data in ways which are inauthentic
to the phenomena being described.

27
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.310
The second obligation is to our audience.

28
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.360
That is there are techniques and data
science and information visualization,

29
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.350
which we can use to shine light
on to specific pieces of data.

30
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.480
Indeed this is generally
the point of the fields.

31
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.240
But if we omitted the ability of the
reader to explore the phenomena more fully

32
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.979
this will generate doubt and
cast distrust.

33
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.880
Cairo gives us a great examples of this,

34
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.710
using a chart inspired by one put
out by the lobbying association.

35
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.640
The national cable and
telecommunications association.

36
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.035
This association lobbies on
behalf of US cable companies.

37
00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:27.238
And provided a graphic which suggested
that, after regulations were relaxed,

38
00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:30.470
cable companies invested four
times as much in the industry.

39
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.650
Now the original chart
has been taken down, but

40
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.090
Cairo provides an example
of what was visualized.

41
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.497
And we can see here, the title of
the chart alone, was intended to draw

42
00:02:41.497 --> 00:02:46.621
the reader to the conclusion, less
regulation means more industry investment.

43
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:49.430
But there's some immediate
problems with this graphic.

44
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.030
First, it's unclear whether
the monies are adjusted for

45
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.420
inflation, which is a big issue when
providing charts of financial data.

46
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.630
Second, the time spans for
the two bars are different.

47
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.510
One covers a span of three years, while
the other covers a span of four years.

48
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.908
Think of this through the lens
of Tufts' Live Factor Analysis.

49
00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:12.310
The bars have the same width, but
don't represent the same period of time.

50
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.900
This is a completely
unforgivable design choice.

51
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.355
And finally, there seems to be a bunch of
missing data from years 1997 and 1998.

52
00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:28.490
And the chart stops in the year 2003,
but the information was tweeted in 2014.

53
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.294
What does a more honest
view of the data look like?

54
00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.500
Well Cairo tracked this down,
and provided a line graph.

55
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.080
We can see that after regulation,

56
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.050
there were in fact years of
sustained industry investment.

57
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.742
We see a slight drop after deregulation,
then a massive spike in spending.

58
00:03:44.742 --> 00:03:47.957
And then a significant fall
from the period post 2002,

59
00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:50.729
much of which is excluded
from the original chart.

60
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.030
While it's unclear whether the dollar
values are in fact corrected for

61
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.440
inflation, seems pretty unreasonable
to suggest from this data alone

62
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.170
that regulations stems cable company
investment and infrastructure.

63
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.680
The lesson here is that,
while there's maybe no absolute truth,

64
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.900
there are ways of displaying data
which are more truthful than others.

65
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.050
The second quality of a visualization
to consider is whether it is

66
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.700
functional or not.

67
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.885
This again is continuum when we saw
an example previously with the slides on

68
00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:25.560
data-ink-ratio provided
by Darkhorse Analytics.

69
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.400
If you expect your audience would
want to compare two data series.

70
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.850
Direct labeling of them is one
way to increase comprehension.

71
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.380
Well there are many heuristics for
increasing functionality,

72
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.792
I would like you to remember
the user test we did with.

73
00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:47.040
I think now is an exciting time for
understating situated human behavior.

74
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.652
The web has dramatically increased
trainability to test social and

75
00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:54.146
behavioral hypothesis that scale
across diverse populations.

76
00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:58.222
And crowd power and mechanical
tuck are just two example of this.

77
00:04:58.222 --> 00:05:02.490
Understanding how functional a given
approach to a visualization is doesn't

78
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.260
necessarily require expensive
ethnographic research.

79
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.706
It's now much easier to test
hypotheses directly with crowd sources.

80
00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:15.849
The third quality of visualization, Cairo
shares is whether it is beautiful or not.

81
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.950
I think that this requires knowing
a great deal about your audience.

82
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.774
There are different perceptions based
on people's lived experiences and

83
00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:27.576
aspects about themselves
such as gender and culture.

84
00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:31.848
There's a lot to building a beautiful
information visualization experience,

85
00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:35.000
which depends on situational and
contextual factors too.

86
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.680
For instance,
if you're building a chart for a report,

87
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.910
the colors and styles that you might
choose, even down the font choice,

88
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.990
might be more related to beauty than for
instance, function.

89
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.760
But the interplay of these elements is
something which is difficult to ignore.

90
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.520
I wonder is this broad topic of beauty one
of the conflationary factors of the chart

91
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.680
junk memorability issue?

92
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.280
Where as Tufte argued that the duck
junk is distracting and misleading,

93
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.640
the study by Bateman et al showed that it
can make visualizations more memorable.

94
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.270
Is this disconnect an issue of
beauty in information graphics?

95
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.600
Here's one parting thought
on beauty in information

96
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.400
that perhaps drives home this quality.

97
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.967
One of the most popular tech magazines,
well known for

98
00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:25.836
it's full page information graphic
spreads is Wired Magazine.

99
00:06:25.836 --> 00:06:30.200
On Wired's website,
they tag these articles as info porn.

100
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.920
A reference to the visceral reaction
that they hope readers will view

101
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.140
when viewing the articles.

102
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.150
The fourth quality of
visualization from Cairo

103
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.870
is that information graphics
should be insightful.

104
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.280
They shouldn't just replicate
data in tables, but

105
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.990
they should draw the viewer in such that
the viewer has an aha or eureka moment.

106
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.710
I think about this largely
in the context of academic

107
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.130
papers where I do most of my work.

108
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.379
A common issue that novice writers have in
this area is the inclusion of a figure for

109
00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.989
every piece of data they have.

110
00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:07.360
This is really unnecessary and adds
bloat and contributes to reader fatigue.

111
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.200
But the right figure drives home
the results of a study quickly.

112
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.730
Scientific peer review is
common in my field, but

113
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.090
readers don't have the large amounts of
time that they need to do full reviews.

114
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.020
When flipping through a submitted paper,

115
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.990
the reviewer sees an image which jumps off
the page and gives them immediate insight.

116
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.730
This sets them up to understand
the more nuanced story

117
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.430
to be told throughout
the rest of the paper.

118
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.650
The final quality of
visualization which Cairo

119
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.520
proposes is information graphics
should be enlightening.

120
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.678
This is different than insightful.

121
00:07:39.678 --> 00:07:44.262
In fact, Cairo argues that this quality
is composed of the previous four,

122
00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:47.633
truthful, functional,
beautiful and insightful.

123
00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:51.189
But he separates and then adds
a social responsibility dimension.

124
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.890
I don't think there's an obvious
answer to this question.

125
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.070
But without a doubt,

126
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:02.160
Cairo's Five Qualities of Great
Visualizations being truthful, functional,

127
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.780
beautiful, insightful, and
enlightening are well worth considering.

128
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.873
Cairo has more great work, and

129
00:08:08.873 --> 00:08:13.220
following this lecture I have
assigned a reading of his as well as

130
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.971
a discussion question to encourage
you to weigh in on the immorality of

131
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:22.017
information visualization as
it relates to data science.

132
00:08:22.017 --> 00:08:24.420
And this ends the week of the course.

133
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.019
We've covered a lot of
material very quickly.

134
00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:30.491
But I really do believe that these
two authors Alberto Ciro and

135
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:34.164
Edward Tufty are fundamental in
building a strong foundation for

136
00:08:34.164 --> 00:08:38.860
the applied data science skills, we'll
focus on in the second week of the course.
