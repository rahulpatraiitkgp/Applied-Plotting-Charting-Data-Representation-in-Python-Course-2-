00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:12.673
In his book, the Functional Art,
Alberto Cairo provides a tool for

2
00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:16.537
thinking about design tradeoffs when
building information graphics, and

3
00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:18.849
he calls this tool
the Visualization Wheel.

4
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.110
In this conceptualization there
are two poles of a circle.

5
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.560
The top one represents highly complex
data which informs at a deep level.

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.790
While the bottom provides easier access to
data but only informs in a shallow manner.

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.960
Inside the circle are dimensions which
describe tradeoffs between two approaches.

8
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.630
While Cairo provides a number
of interesting dimensions.

9
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.767
It's important to note
that this is a tool for

10
00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:45.400
designers to think about
their visualizations.

11
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.070
And not so much an analytics tool itself.

12
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.870
Your needs from any particular
problem might change which of

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.790
these dimensions are important or

14
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.575
might introduce new dimensions
which you should be thinking about.

15
00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:00.760
Cairo actually suggests a role in an
organization or a professional background

16
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.410
might also influence the kinds
of graphics we want to make.

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.799
So I'd like to ask you as someone
who's studying data science,

18
00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.893
who are you trying to reach
through your visualizations?

19
00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:18.800
Let's dig in and look at a few of
the trade offs that Cairo considers.

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.710
The first is abstraction and figuration.

21
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.320
A highly figurative visual describes
the phenomenon using physical

22
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.830
representations of the phenomena,
such as photographs or drawings.

23
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.230
As the representations
become less real and

24
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.570
more conceptual, the emphasis shifts
from figuration to abstraction.

25
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.660
The second dimension he discusses is,
is functionality and decoration.

26
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.710
A completely functional graphic
has no embellishments and

27
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.980
is closer to a direct
representation of the data.

28
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.600
While a heavily decorated graphic
has more artistic embellishments.

29
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.550
As it is with all of these dimensions,
there isn't a clear better or worse.

30
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.150
Embellishments may increase
the amount of time a viewer

31
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.240
spends considering the visual.

32
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.900
Exploring it's nuances and

33
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.680
forming mental associations which may
increase familiarity and memorability.

34
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.990
The third dimension is density and

35
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.050
lightness as they relate to the amount
of information being shown.

36
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.910
There are lots of great examples
of this in scientific visuals,

37
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.910
where some figures are intended
to be studied in depth,

38
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.580
while others are meant to
quickly augment a narrative.

39
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.930
You can see this dimension at play
when comparing magazine infographics,

40
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.960
where the reader is likely to be
more heavily engaged in the content.

41
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.610
Two advertisements in the same magazine
where readers are likely to only

42
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.680
quickly consider an ad.

43
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.120
Here's an example from my field of study
which was published by Harvard and

44
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.230
MIT describing the patterns
of access of users

45
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.060
in the edX massive open
online course platform.

46
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.320
Take a moment to study this image.

47
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.590
What sense can you make of this image?

48
00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:06.977
If we consider Cairo's third dimension.

49
00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:11.780
It'd be tough not to say that
this is a fairly dense graphic.

50
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.460
The main portion of the graphic,
a scatterplot,

51
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.000
has two axes which are labeled, as do
each of the two subplots to the left and

52
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.200
the bottom, which are histograms.

53
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.930
The axis for

54
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.940
the histograms can be a bit confusing as
they bleed into the scatterplot axis, but

55
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.218
change the unit of measure and
the direction of the measurement.

56
00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:34.601
For instance, in the X axis at
the top of the scatter plot,

57
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.607
percentage of chapters access is
being used as the unit of measure and

58
00:03:38.607 --> 00:03:42.354
increases as you move towards
the right hand side of the figure.

59
00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:46.425
You have the same X axis for the histogram
to the left of the graph is in

60
00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:52.060
thousands of persons and increases as
you move to the left side of the figure.

61
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.560
There's some red lines
overlayed on the graphic.

62
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.110
Breaking the scatter plot roughly into
quadrants, but with minimal labeling it's

63
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.670
a little unclear what
the quadrants end up representing.

64
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.690
Regardless of whether
this is a good figure or

65
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.270
not, it would certainly be considered
an example of a dense figure.

66
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.730
The fourth aspect Cairo maps is
the dimensionality of the graphic.

67
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.410
A multidimensional graphic describes
a phenomena as a whole and

68
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.880
invites the viewer to explore many
different aspects of the phenomena.

69
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.182
A unidimensional graphic
instead focuses on a single or

70
00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:30.940
a few items and
explores them in one or more ways.

71
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.601
The fifth dimension is originality and
familiarity.

72
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:38.792
In the modern world, we're used to
seeing a plethora of different kinds of

73
00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:42.463
information graphics,
things like bar charts and line charts.

74
00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:45.796
And thinking in terms of these
representations is taught at a very

75
00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:47.010
young age.

76
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.140
For instance, my daughter,
who's almost five,

77
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.720
came home from preschool the other day
with a page that showed a bar chart.

78
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.900
That she and others had made in class.

79
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.550
To celebrate learning about the American
election, the whole class got together and

80
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.060
had a vote on what they would have for

81
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.690
snack, chocolate ice cream or
mint chocolate chip ice cream.

82
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.410
Of course, mint chocolate chip ice
cream won, as one might expect.

83
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.343
But, my point here, is that, these
are basic ways of thinking about data in

84
00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:15.489
a graphical form and
they are now being taught very early on.

85
00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:18.154
And this makes them familiar
to a broad population.

86
00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:21.085
This wasn't always so though.

87
00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:25.515
It's safe to say that the bar chart
is fairly familiar to most people but

88
00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:27.555
a graphic with more originalities,

89
00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:31.585
elements that need to be explained or
studied by the user.

90
00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:35.183
Here's a very famous
graphic by Charles Mender.

91
00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:39.770
It describes Napoleon's
march into Russia in 1812.

92
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.130
Take a moment to study the graphic.

93
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.010
Broadly speaking, there are five different
kinds of information being visualize in

94
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.100
this graphic.

95
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.190
How many of those five pieces do you see?

96
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.692
Here's what I see.

97
00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:57.340
First there are elements of
geography showing us the various

98
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.640
rivers in towns along the way.

99
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.241
The width of the tan upper bar represents
the size of Napoleon's army, and

100
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:09.135
you can see it shrinks from the beginning
of the campaign from 422,000 to

101
00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:12.365
only 100,000 once the French reach Moscow.

102
00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:16.421
The lower black bar shows Napoleon's
retreat from Russia, and there are various

103
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:20.850
points along it which are mapped to
dates and temperatures in Celsius.

104
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.730
We see the bar thins dramatically
as the army shrinks in size.

105
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.405
So the five kinds of data in Mender's
visualization include location,

106
00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:34.848
direction, temperature,
army size and dates.

107
00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:40.911
The last dimension which Cairo shares is
the novelty and redundancy dimension.

108
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:45.115
Redundancy is the tendency of a graphic
to tell the same story in many

109
00:06:45.115 --> 00:06:46.232
different ways.

110
00:06:46.232 --> 00:06:50.870
For instance, you might use the height of
bars on a bar chart with an axis as well

111
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.203
as color to emphasize the largest bar.

112
00:06:53.203 --> 00:06:56.407
This one's a bit tricky,
you don't want to bore your readers or

113
00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:58.289
make your graphics overly complex.

114
00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.478
But you do want to encode information in a
way which supports their understanding of

115
00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:04.960
the phenomena you've described.

116
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.007
On this dimension,

117
00:07:06.007 --> 00:07:10.084
novelty is the act of describing each
phenomena in the graphic in only one way.

118
00:07:11.818 --> 00:07:14.780
There are no rights and
wrongs in the visualization wheel.

119
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.170
The purpose of the wheel is
to help you understand and

120
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.610
compare the visual
approaches you might take.

121
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.580
As a reflective activity, Cairo suggested
you can plot your thinking, a long each of

122
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.720
these dimensions and then join those
points together, to create a radar plot.

123
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.980
Here Cairo provides two examples of
the visualization wheel in action.

124
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.330
On the left hand side you see there is
more emphasis towards complex visuals.

125
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.750
Those which are dense, multidimensional
and have high functionality.

126
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.730
On the right,
you see the visualization wheel.

127
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.900
There are more elements of decoration,
lightness, and figuration.

128
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.000
Cairo suggests that the left
wheel is more indicative of work

129
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.860
being done by scientists and engineers,
while the right wheel is more

130
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.170
indicative of work being done by artists,
graphic designers, and journalists.

131
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.350
This tension between how scientists and
engineers might view the visualization of

132
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.330
data, and how artists and
journalists might, is an interesting one.

133
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.210
And we'll revisit it at
the end of next week.

134
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.550
In the next lecture, we'll go a bit
deeper, and consider some heuristics from

135
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.249
Edward Tufte,
as to what makes a good visualization.

136
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.820
The visualization wheel is one tool which
we have in order to better compare two

137
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.920
different ways of visualizing information.

138
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.810
In the next lecture,
we'll dig in a bit and

139
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.690
see how you might use the visualization
wheel to evaluate your own graphics.
